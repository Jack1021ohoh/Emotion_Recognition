# Emotion Recognition

---
### Description
This project is the final project for the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery course, where I used Python to develop models for recognizing emotions in Twitter messages, including anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise. The analysis began with generating word clouds to identify common words associated with each emotion category.

Subsequently, I trained multiple deep learning models to accurately classify emotions in the Twitter messages. In addition to these models, I experimented with Few-shot Prompting on large language models (LLMs) to explore its effectiveness in emotion recognition.
