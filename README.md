# Emotion Recognition

---
### Description
This project is the final project for the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery course, where I used Python to develop models to recognize the emotions of Twitter messages (including anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise). First, I used wordcloud to find out the common words used in each category. Next, I trained multiple deep learning models to recognize emotion in Twitter messages. Moreover, I tried to do Few-shot Prompting on LLM to perform this task.
